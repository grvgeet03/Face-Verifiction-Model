# **Deep Facial Verification Model**

A real-time facial verification application built using Kivy for the user interface, OpenCV for webcam processing, and TensorFlow for running a Siamese Neural Network model. This project is designed for verifying faces by comparing live webcam feed input with pre-stored images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

1. **Siamese Neural Networks (SNN)**
   - This project leverages **Siamese Neural Networks (SNN)** for facial verification. Understanding how SNNs work is essential for comprehending how the model compares and verifies facial images.
   - Key concepts include:
     - Twin networks sharing the same weights.
     - Contrastive loss function to measure similarity between image pairs.
     - One-shot learning for facial verification tasks.

2. **TensorFlow and Keras**
   - The model is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. A basic understanding of these libraries is required for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
   - Key skills include:
     - Model creation and compilation in Keras.
     - Training and fine-tuning deep learning models.
     - Using TensorFlow for low-level model management and deployment.

3. **Computer Vision (CV)**
   - **Computer Vision** techniques are used for image preprocessing, face detection, and feature extraction.
   - You should be familiar with:
     - Image preprocessing methods like resizing, normalization, and conversion.
     - Using **OpenCV** for handling webcam input, image manipulation, and saving images.
     - Basic face detection algorithms for recognizing faces in images and video.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Kivy**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **TensorFlow**: To define and load the Siamese Neural Network for facial verification.
- **OpenCV**: For video capture and preprocessing.
- **Python**: The core language for development.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Face Capture**: Captures live video from the webcam and displays it in real-time.
- **Face Verification**: Verifies the face in the webcam feed by comparing it with a reference image stored in the system.
- **Siamese Neural Network**: Uses a pre-trained Siamese network model to calculate the similarity between two faces.
- **User Interface**: Simple Kivy-based UI with a button for initiating the verification process.
- **Verification Result**: Displays whether the faces match or not in the UI.
